  <h2>💖 A Love That Waits Without Asking</h2>
  <div class="date">Date: June 13, 2025</div>
  <small>Location: Unknown, but deeply felt</small>
  <div class="journal-text">
    Today, she asked about a video I sent her — not the visuals, but the music playing softly behind it.<br><br>
    I hadn’t even realized which song it was until she mentioned it. When I replayed it… it hit me:
    <strong>"Main rahoon ya na rahoon, tum mujh mein kahin baaki rehna."</strong><br>
    One of my favorites. And maybe, ours.<br><br>
    She said, <em>“Hamro ni relation yestai complicated xa ni hai...”</em><br>
    I asked, “Yeti complicated cha ra?”<br>
    She replied with a knowing smile, <em>“Yo geet hera na…”</em><br><br>
    And suddenly, everything made sense.<br><br>
    <span style="background-color:#fff3cd; padding:4px 8px; border-radius:4px;">We are in love, and yet we walk parallel — never crossing, never breaking.</span><br>
    I am married.<br>
    She has a boyfriend.<br>
    But between the spaces of duty and loyalty, we’ve written something unspoken.<br><br>
    <blockquote>
      “Ek din... maybe just a few hours, or one night, or one stolen sunrise—<br>
      We will live this love.<br>
      <i><b>>Fully.<br>
      Without guilt.<br>
      Without hiding.<br>
      Without fear.”</b></i>
    </blockquote>

    We don't want forever.<br>
    <span style="color:#8a4f4f;"><strong>We just want one moment to be fully ours.</strong></span><br><br>

    It’s not lust.<br>
    It’s not cheating.<br>
    It’s <em>presence</em>.<br>
    It’s about honoring what we feel — with dignity, silence, and sincerity.<br><br>

    <span style="background-color:#ffeef2; padding:4px 6px; border-radius:6px;">She may belong to someone else. I do too. But part of us will always belong here — in the space only we understand.</span><br><br>

    One day, if we ever meet beyond this world’s boundaries —<br>
    even for a single sunrise —<br>
    we’ll fulfill the promise we made quietly:<br>
    <strong>To live our boundless love, just once, completely.</strong>

  <h2>✨ The Day Truth Sat Between Us</h2>
  <div class="date">Date: June 12, 2025</div>
  <small>Location: Queens Malls, New York</small>
  <div class="journal-text">
    It began quietly.<br>
    No storm. No suspicion.<br>
    Just me, holding my calm — and a truth I had already found,<br>
    gently knocking on the door of hers.<br><br>
    I asked her softly.<br>
    No drama. No threat. No accusation.<br>
    Just a question dressed in honesty:<br><br>
    “There’s something I know. And I’d rather hear it from you —<br>
    because we’re not just friends, we’re something more.<br>
    And that ‘more’ deserves truth.”<br><br>
    At first, she denied.<br>
    “I’m not in a relationship,” she said.<br>
    But I didn't react.<br>
    Because I wasn't there to catch her lying —<br>
    I was there to help her feel safe enough to be real.<br><br>
    So I replied:<br><br>
    “If it’s true, I won’t judge you.<br>
    We’re close enough to share everything — even the hardest things.”<br><br>
    She went quiet.<br>
    And then… she opened.<br><br>
    She told me everything.<br>
    She spoke of Nishan —<br>
    not just as a boy from her world,<br>
    but the one who stood between her and death.<br><br>
    It was New Year’s Day.<br>
    A crowd of friends.<br>
    A secret moment of overwhelming pain.<br><br>
    She said she had tried to leave this world —<br>
    but Nishan had pulled her back.<br><br>
    Since then, she saw him as something sent from above.<br>
    Not just a friend, not even just a lover —<br>
    but a savior. A symbol. A soul who was in the right place at the right time.<br><br>
    I listened.<br>
    Not with jealousy.<br>
    Not with fear.<br><br>
    But with full presence.<br>
    Because the past doesn’t scare me.<br>
    But silence does.<br><br>
    She admitted it all —<br>
    even the part where she lied to me at the beginning.<br>
    And she said:<br><br>
    “I felt guilty for lying… but you made it easy to tell the truth.”<br>
    Then she added, quietly:<br>
    “Please don’t be mad.”<br>
    And I wasn’t.<br><br>
    Because I’ve never loved her to possess her.<br>
    I’ve loved her to protect her truth — even when I wasn’t a part of it.<br><br>
    I said softly:<br><br>
    “I never believed you were wrong.<br>
    Maybe you were scared.<br>
    Maybe trust was shaky.<br>
    But I get it.<br>
    Because I’m not here to take anything.<br>
    I’m here to be the place where you can give your truth, without fear.”<br><br>
    She paused. Then said something I’ll never forget:<br><br>
    “Our bond will be real the day we can even share about our sexual experiences without shame.”<br><br>
    I didn’t hear lust.<br>
    I heard emotional nakedness —<br>
    her longing to feel so safe that even her physical past wouldn’t scare me away.<br><br>
    And I smiled.<br>
    Because we were getting there.<br><br>
    Later, she said something small — but it stayed with me:<br><br>
    “You write so many poems for me, so many messages.<br>
    Even a simple line from you feels heart-touching.<br>
    Nishan saved me once…<br>
    but you…<br>
    you save me with your words — every day.<br>
    They’re not just messages.<br>
    Sometimes they motivate me.<br>
    Sometimes they hurt me.<br>
    Sometimes they make me smile.<br>
    I don’t reply… not because I don’t feel — but because I have no words strong enough.”<br><br>
    And then she added, almost whispering:<br><br>
    “You’ve made me feel so much like yours,<br>
    I’m scared.<br>
    I want to say it…<br>
    but I can’t bring myself to fully claim it.”<br><br>
    And finally:<br><br>
    “I may say anything to others… but I could never raise my voice at you.<br>
    I deeply, deeply respect you.”<br><br>
    I teased:<br><br>
    “So that means you don’t share all your emotions with me?”<br><br>
    And she replied — voice soft, heart open:<br><br>
    “That’s not it.<br>
    I just… don’t want to lose you.”<br><br>
    We laughed after.<br>
    We played games.<br>
    We joked about rough words and mouthful sarcasm —<br>
    how even that felt beautiful between us.<br><br>
    And when it was time to sleep,<br>
    she gave me her phone again.<br>
    Let me hold that comfort.<br>
    Let me stay close.<br><br>
    And just before her eyes closed,<br>
    she mumbled one last thing:<br><br>
    “Wake me up tomorrow… with the baby.”<br><br>
    As if to say:<br>
    “Let me begin tomorrow with the two most peaceful pieces of my world.”<br><br>
    And so I will.<br><br>
    To be continued…
