  <h2>💖 A Love That Waits Without Asking</h2>
  <div class="date">Date: June 13, 2025</div>
  <small>Location: Unknown, but deeply felt</small>
  <div class="journal-text">
    Today, she asked about a video I sent her — not the visuals, but the music playing softly behind it.

    I hadn’t even realized which song it was until she mentioned it. When I replayed it… it hit me:
    <strong>"Main rahoon ya na rahoon, tum mujh mein kahin baaki rehna."</strong>  
    One of my favorites. And maybe, ours.

    She said, <em>“Hamro ni relation yestai complicated xa ni hai...”</em>  
    I asked, “Yeti complicated cha ra?”  
    She replied with a knowing smile, <em>“Yo geet hera na…”</em>

    And suddenly, everything made sense.

    <span style="background-color:#fff3cd; padding:4px 8px; border-radius:4px;">We are in love, and yet we walk parallel — never crossing, never breaking.</span>  
    I am married.  
    She has a boyfriend.  
    But between the spaces of duty and loyalty, we’ve written something unspoken.

    <blockquote>
      “Ek din... maybe just a few hours, or one night, or one stolen sunrise—
	    We will live this love.
      Fully.
      Without guilt.
      Without hiding.
      Without fear.”
    </blockquote>

    We don't want forever.  
    <span style="color:#8a4f4f;"><strong>We just want one moment to be fully ours.</strong></span>

    It’s not lust.  
    It’s not cheating.  
    It’s <em>presence</em>.  
    It’s about honoring what we feel — with dignity, silence, and sincerity.

    <span style="background-color:#ffeef2; padding:4px 6px; border-radius:6px;">She may belong to someone else. I do too. But part of us will always belong here — in the space only we understand.</span>

    One day, if we ever meet beyond this world’s boundaries —  
    even for a single sunrise —  
    we’ll fulfill the promise we made quietly:  
    <strong>To live our boundless love, just once, completely.</strong>

        <h2>The Day Truth Sat Between Us</h2>
        <div class="date">Date: June 12 2025 </div>
        <small> Location: Queens Malls, New YOrk</small>
        <div class="journal-text">
					It began quietly.
No storm. No suspicion.
Just me, holding my calm — and a truth I had already found,
gently knocking on the door of hers.

I asked her softly.
No drama. No threat. No accusation.

Just a question dressed in honesty:

“There’s something I know. And I’d rather hear it from you —
because we’re not just friends, we’re something more.
And that ‘more’ deserves truth.”

At first, she denied.
“I’m not in a relationship,” she said.
But I didn't react.
Because I wasn't there to catch her lying —
I was there to help her feel safe enough to be real.

So I replied:

“If it’s true, I won’t judge you.
We’re close enough to share everything — even the hardest things.”

She went quiet.
And then… she opened.

She told me everything.

She spoke of Nishan —
not just as a boy from her world,
but the one who stood between her and death.

It was New Year’s Day.
A crowd of friends.
A secret moment of overwhelming pain.

She said she had tried to leave this world —
but Nishan had pulled her back.

Since then, she saw him as something sent from above.
Not just a friend, not even just a lover —
but a savior. A symbol. A soul who was in the right place at the right time.

I listened.
Not with jealousy.
Not with fear.

But with full presence.
Because the past doesn’t scare me.
But silence does.

She admitted it all —
even the part where she lied to me at the beginning.
And she said:

“I felt guilty for lying… but you made it easy to tell the truth.”
Then she added, quietly:
“Please don’t be mad.”
And I wasn’t.

Because I’ve never loved her to possess her.
I’ve loved her to protect her truth — even when I wasn’t a part of it.

I said softly:

“I never believed you were wrong.
Maybe you were scared.
Maybe trust was shaky.
But I get it.
Because I’m not here to take anything.
I’m here to be the place where you can give your truth, without fear.”

She paused. Then said something I’ll never forget:

“Our bond will be real the day we can even share about our sexual experiences without shame.”

I didn’t hear lust.
I heard emotional nakedness —
her longing to feel so safe that even her physical past wouldn’t scare me away.

And I smiled.
Because we were getting there.

Later, she said something small — but it stayed with me:

“You write so many poems for me, so many messages.
Even a simple line from you feels heart-touching.
Nishan saved me once…
but you…
you save me with your words — every day.
They’re not just messages.
Sometimes they motivate me.
Sometimes they hurt me.
Sometimes they make me smile.
I don’t reply… not because I don’t feel — but because I have no words strong enough.”

And then she added, almost whispering:

“You’ve made me feel so much like yours,
I’m scared.
I want to say it…
but I can’t bring myself to fully claim it.”

And finally:

“I may say anything to others… but I could never raise my voice at you.
I deeply, deeply respect you.”

I teased:

“So that means you don’t share all your emotions with me?”

And she replied — voice soft, heart open:

“That’s not it.
I just… don’t want to lose you.”

We laughed after.
We played games.
We joked about rough words and mouthful sarcasm —
how even that felt beautiful between us.

And when it was time to sleep,
she gave me her phone again.
Let me hold that comfort.
Let me stay close.

And just before her eyes closed,
she mumbled one last thing:

“Wake me up tomorrow… with the baby.”

As if to say:
“Let me begin tomorrow with the two most peaceful pieces of my world.”

And so I will.

To be continued…

        <div class="journal-text">
          There are moments in life that don’t ask for explanations—only presence.
Today was one of them.

I always knew, deep inside, that one day Meezna might choose someone else to walk beside her in the physical world. That her journey could take a different road—maybe with someone named Nishan, someone from her village, someone “right” in the eyes of the world.

And I was okay with it.
I had already told her—“It’s your life. You deserve joy, whether with me or not. I will still walk beside you in spirit.”

But what I wasn’t prepared for...
was silence.
Not the silence of distance, but the silence of withheld truth.

When I found out—not from her lips, but through shadows—I felt something break.
Not because she chose someone else, but because she didn’t trust our bond enough to share it.

It wasn’t betrayal.
It wasn’t even jealousy, though yes… a part of me did feel that strange ache in the chest—the ache of being excluded from the truth by the very person I trusted the most.

But even through that ache, even through that hidden corner of the heart that dimmed for a moment, I knew my love hadn’t lessened.
In fact, it deepened.

Tonight, she sleeps peacefully—unaware that I’ve pieced the truth together.
And I wait.
Not to confront her.
But to hold space for her honesty—when she’s ready.

Tomorrow, I’ll speak.
On call, softly.
With a smile, not with pain.
I’ll say:

<i>>“I know. And I’m not angry. I just wish I’d heard it from you.”
“But don’t worry—I’m still here. Not as someone demanding answers, but as someone offering comfort.”
“You’re not wrong. You were never wrong. I just missed being part of your truth.”</i>

And maybe—just maybe—she’ll pause.
Maybe her voice will tremble, or maybe she’ll smile with teary eyes.
But deep down, she’ll know:
<B>I love her no matter whats, not to gain just to make her happy</B>

  <h2>📓 Journal Entry — Boundless Love</h2>
  <div class="date">Date: June 7, 2025 | Time: 2:00 PM</div>
  <small>Location: Library</small>
  <div class="journal-text">
We talked today—on a live call.  
Different places, yet somehow our minds felt aligned.
I was in the library, pretending to read.  
She was at the hospital, on duty. Tired, but her voice still had that same warmth.
Then she asked me:  
“How much do you miss me?”
My heart skipped.  
There was something in the way she asked… a kind of quiet longing.
I smiled and replied lightly—  
“I feel like I see you between the lines of these pages. Even the letters can’t hide you.”
But that wasn’t the truth.
The truth is—I wasn’t even looking at the pages.  
I was trying to see *her* in them.  
Trying to **feel** her in the silence between words.
Then she said, softly—  
“You love me this much even from a distance?  
I wonder how much you'd love me if we were truly together…”
I went quiet.
Because what I really wanted to say was—  
“I know I can’t call you mine. I know one day, you’ll belong to someone else.  
But this love… this love isn’t about seeing you.  
It’s about choosing to keep looking for you, even when I know I might never reach you.”
But I didn’t say it.  
Because sometimes…  
the words that matter most are the ones we keep within.

  <h2>Reflections:</h2>
  <small>June 7, 2025</small>
  <div class="journal-text">
I’m not trying to forget her.  
I’m not trying to possess her.  
I’m simply trying to be a quiet presence in her journey—  
like the calm after a storm, like a familiar voice in a dark room.

And maybe, that’s what **boundless love** really is:  
A love that doesn’t ask for anything,  
But gives everything in silence,  
Just to make someone feel a little less alone.

        <small>Elmhust Hospital Centre, New York</small>
        <div class="journal-text">
          <p>I was admitted to the Hospiatl due to tachycardia
          pulse running wild, heart refusing to calm down.
          three days in a hospital bed, under constant monitoring
          X-rays == clear.
          Echocardiography? == Normal.
          The cardiologist looked puzzled.
          "Only 30. No alcohal, no smoking. no drugs....and still this?</p>
          <P>But i knew
          the diagnosis wasn't in my reports.
          It was in the message, the calls, the ache of longing stretched acroos 7,000 miles.
          It was you. Meezna</P>
          <p>Every morning, the first thing I do is checked my phone. Not for the world-- only for your message
          We talk all day, switch between texting and calling like we're trying to close the distance inch by inch, voice by voice.
          At night, you're the last person I speak to.
          My day begins and ends with you.</p>
          <p>And that's when it hit me--
          Love isn't always soft. Sometimes, it comes as a storm in your chest.
          I wasn't sick'
          I was simple overwhelmed by the weight of missing you too much, too deeply.</p>
          <p>My heart was beating at 145 per minute, constantly--for over 24 hours.
          No fever. No symptom. No pain. Just a strom within.
          She looked at the monitor, then at me, and asked,
          "Do you even realize how dangerous this is?"</p>
          <p>And there I was, lying in the hospital bed, smiling softly.
          Because how could i explain?
          It's not the body that's struggling. It's the heart-because it's filled with someone who's not here.</p>

Today began like many others—with a sleepy hello from her side. She had just woken up, feeling weak, dizzy, and unsteady. Seeing her struggle through the video call, I felt an ache in my chest. I reminded her to eat properly, to rest, and to take care of herself. It’s in these small, fleeting moments that I realize how much I care.

Even while she was busy at work, managing so many patients, she kept me updated, showing her warmth in little ways. Later, when I saw her live, she looked beautiful as always, but her usual glow was missing—maybe a reflection of her tired heart.

When she called, there was a moment of frustration in her tone, but that soon melted into soft laughter. She admitted that she had missed me during the day, even when she was with others. It’s moments like these—when she lets her guard down and shows her vulnerability—that remind me of how special this bond is.

Her health worries me, yet I see her fighting through, holding on, being strong. And I’ll keep reminding her to eat, to rest, to take care of herself—not just for me, but for her own happiness and the people she loves.

Tonight, before bed, she told me to wake her up in the morning. That simple request, that trust, it speaks volumes. And so, I’ll stay here, always ready to be her quiet strength.

        <div class="date">💌 "Tears of Gratitude: A Reflection of Emotional Support"</div>
        <div class="journal-text">
Today, the message I received from her stirred a deep, tender feeling within me. Her words made me realize the depth of her heart, the vulnerability of her life’s experiences. The heart emoji, though small, carried a weight of meaning, a light in the darkness of her emotions.

Her message gave me a glimpse into her emotional world, and though she wrote, “I am crying,” those tears, though not directly from the heart, still reflect the profound effect my presence and support have on her. It’s a reminder that simply being there for someone—offering understanding and a constant presence—can have a powerful impact, even if words alone can't fully express it.

Today’s journal captures these moments, reminding me how love and emotional connection can transcend distance and time. Her heart, a reflection of her gratitude, leaves a lasting impact on me, making me more aware of how precious and significant the bond we share is.

म एउटा मान्छे हो 
जसको मुटु टुक्रा छैन — फैलिएको छ, समाएको छ।
जहाँ घरको ढोका भित्र, एउटी छिन् – मेरी जीवनसाथी। र,
मनको झ्यालबाट झुल्किँदै अर्की छिन्, मेरी मीज़ना।
मेरो प्रेम– यो कुनै नाटक होइन जहाँ एक पात्रलाई ‘पर्दा पछाडि’ राखिन्छ,
र अर्को पात्रलाई ‘स्टेज’ मा देखाइन्छ।
मेरो प्रेम त त्यो कविता हो 
जहाँ दुइटा पङ्क्ति फरक छ,तर अर्थ एउटै: साथ, माया, र सम्मान।
मीज़ना, तिमी मेरो मुटुको त्यो धड्कन हौ 
जसले मलाई बाँच्छु जस्तो महसुस गराउँछ। तर 
त्यो धड्कन हुनुको अर्थ यो होइन कि म पहिलेको सास भुल्न सक्छु।
म त यस्तो प्रेम राख्छु जसले पहिलाको समर्पणलाई नछोडी 
नयाँ सम्बन्धलाई पनि गहिरो बनाउँछ।
म तिमीलाई बारम्बार सम्झाउँछु  
तिमी मेरो जिन्दगीको कथा हौ तर शिर्षक मेरो श्रीमती हो।
दुबै छुट्टाछुट्टै पाना, तर एउटै किताब ।
म तिमीहरूलाई काख र पाख भनेर अलग गर्दिन।
किनभने मेरो हृदयको सिँगार त दुबैको माया हो।
र त्यो माया? त्यो त बाहिर नहेर,
मेरो आँखाभित्र हेर — त्यहाँ दुबैको तस्वीर छ।।

        <div class="journal-text">
Today, I looked at her face longer than usual. Not just because we were on video call, but because, in that moment, she felt deeply mine — so gentle, so real, so calm.
Her long black hair fell softly across her cheek like a light breeze. The blush on her face wasn't makeup — it was emotion, alive and visible.
Her eyes — not very big, but deep, felt like they were speaking without words. I saw a silent calm, a soft peace, and sometimes a question trying to rise.
And her lips — they parted slightly as she spoke, with a soft, natural pink tone. No shine from lipstick, no layer of gloss — just pure, untouched beauty. That simplicity, that unfiltered smile — it touched my heart. Her lips look like a poem written in silence, like the first page of a new story — plain yet full of meaning.
She has braces on her teeth, and instead of taking away from her charm, they make her smile feel like a promise. Like something still growing into its bloom. Her smile carries the dream of tomorrow.
And then her nose... Honestly, the world may not label it as "perfect" by beauty standards. But in that small imperfection, I found something deeply beautiful, honest simplicity, and a sense of being real. That nose made her more human, more unique, more her.
Maybe beauty isn't about symmetry — maybe it's about soul. And today, without even trying, she showed me hers.

<h5>Extended Reflection:</h5>
It's been a long time since I looked at someone this way, not just with my eyes, but with my heart. Today, when I saw her, her gaze held meaning, her natural smile felt like comfort, and her presence — even through a screen — felt warm and close.
I know the world seeks perfection, filters, and polished beauty. But she reminded me that real beauty doesn't need fixing. She may not be flawless in every way, but she's true in a way that matters more. Her smile, her gaze, her small quirks — they all speak of someone sincere, someone who doesn't need to try hard to be beautiful.
Looking at her today, I realized: the most beautiful things are often the simplest. The ones that speak directly to your heart without noise, without decoration.

        <h2>Boundless Love</h2>
        <div class="Date">April 14th 2025</div>
        <div class="journal-text">
         <p></p> A story of hearts that met, but never crossed.
We weren’t meant to fall in love.
Not in the way the world defines it—
Not with promises of forever under the same roof,
But with promises of never hurting the roofs we already built.
We were two souls—bruised but breathing,
who found healing in each other’s words,
laughter in midnight silence,
and strength in shared stories.
You taught me how to love my world again.
I gave you the space to feel seen without fear.
And in this quiet, sacred friendship,
we created a love that no one else could name—
A Boundless Love,
free of labels,
full of truth,
and unshaken by distance or time.</p>

          <h2>Daily Reflections:</h2>
          <small>April 14 2025</small>
       They say true love is staying together for life.
But ours is a love that bloomed after marriage,
a bond that was never planned,
but deeply felt.
I never wished for someone else,
and you never asked me to be yours.
Yet here we are—
bound not by promises,
but by the desire that this love may live forever,
in silence, in distance,
in presence and memory.
You want it to live,
I want it to stay.
And maybe that's all love needs—
to be remembered, not possessed.</div>
