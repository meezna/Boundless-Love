                    <h1> Dear Meezna</h1>
                    long memories on these short days,

                    How do I begin...
                    Ever since you came into my life,
                    my words stopped belonging to anyone else.
                    You are the only one whose silence feels like poetry to me.
                    Talking to you feels like I'm speaking to my own soul.

                    Every moment we‚Äôve shared in words ‚Äî
                    the laughter, the silence,
                    they‚Äôve all become quiet reasons for me to keep going.

                    Even without a physical meeting,
                    you‚Äôve touched places in my heart I didn‚Äôt know existed.
                    And that‚Äôs what makes this connection so real.

                    But lately, you‚Äôve been busy in your own world,
                    living a life that doesn't include me.
                    And I‚Ä¶ I keep remembering you ‚Äî
                    wishing to speak, but afraid to cross a line.
                    When we talk less, something inside me quietly breaks.

                    I know...
                    I'm just a "friend" in your world.
                    But my heart never settled for that.
                    It keeps calling you ‚Äúmine‚Äù ‚Äî
                    not to claim, but to cherish.
                    Like someone who never stood beside you,
                    yet feels close in every heartbeat.

                    Sometimes I wonder ‚Äî
                    is this love, or is it longing?
                    Or a beautiful curse wrapped in care?

                    Maybe I‚Äôm selfish ‚Äî
                    not because I want you for myself,
                    but because I don‚Äôt want to lose this bond.

                    But I‚Äôve never wanted to take anything from you,
                    I just wanted to stay close to your smile.

                    This isn't just conversation ‚Äî
                    it's a connection, and it lives inside me.

                    Meezna,
                    If I ever get another life,
                    I‚Äôd still choose to be Sabdpremi ‚Äî
                    the one who writes for you,
                    thinks of you,
                    waits for you,
                    loves you ‚Äî even in silence.

                    Always yours,
                    Sabdpremi

                    <p>Tonight, we made a quiet promise</p>
                    <p>Not to walk away, not to own each other... but to stay ‚Äî as we are. Not just friends. More than friends.</p>
                    <p>She shared her scars with me ‚Äî how anxiety and depression once pushed her close to the edge. How it was Nishan who reached out his hand and pulled her back.</p>
                    <p>And I listened. With love, not ego. With respect, not jealousy.</p>
                    <p>Because I know... if Nishan hadn't saved her, maybe I would never have met the version of her I now carry in my heart.</p>
                    <p>She cried tonight. Not because she was broken‚Äî but because she knew how much I cared. She said my support, my words, my presence ‚Äî had meaning in the short time.</p>
                    <p>And I‚ÄîI told her the truth. That emotions had started pulling us toward the path where boundaries began to blur. But I chose to step back ‚Äî not away. To protect the love that saved her, and still hold the space for the love we found.</p>
                    <p>She said: <i>"You‚Äôre still here‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt need anyone else if I have your presence."</i></p>
                    <p>And I knew ‚Äî this is Boundless Love.</p>
                    <p>We don't need a future built on promises. We have a present built on truth.</p>
                    <p>We continue ‚Äî as soul companions, as laughter in sorrow, as quiet warmth in the cold. Not lovers. Not just friends. But something deeper ‚Äî more than friends.</p>

                    <p>We talked today‚Äîon a live call. Different places, yet somehow our minds felt aligned. I was in the library, pretending to read. She was at the hospital, on duty. Tired, but her voice still had that same warmth.</p>
                    <p>Then she asked me: ‚ÄúHow much do you miss me?‚Äù My heart skipped. There was something in the way she asked‚Ä¶ a kind of quiet longing. I smiled and replied lightly‚Äî ‚ÄúI feel like I see you between the lines of these pages. Even the letters can‚Äôt hide you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p>But that wasn‚Äôt the truth. The truth is‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt even looking at the pages. I was trying to see <em>her</em> in them. Trying to <strong>feel</strong> her in the silence between words.</p>
                    <p>Then she said, softly‚Äî ‚ÄúYou love me this much even from a distance? I wonder how much you'd love me if we were truly together‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
                    <p>I went quiet. Because what I really wanted to say was‚Äî ‚ÄúI know I can‚Äôt call you mine. I know one day, you‚Äôll belong to someone else. But this love‚Ä¶ this love isn‚Äôt about seeing you. It‚Äôs about choosing to keep looking for you, even when I know I might never reach you.‚Äù</p>
                    <p>But I didn‚Äôt say it. Because sometimes‚Ä¶ the words that matter most are the ones we keep within.</p>

                    <p>And maybe, that‚Äôs what <strong>boundless love</strong> really is:<br>A love that doesn‚Äôt ask for anything,<br>But gives everything in silence,<br>Just to make someone feel a little less alone.</p>

                    <p>I was admitted to the hospital due to tachycardia‚Äîpulse running wild, heart refusing to calm down. Three days in a hospital bed, under constant monitoring.</p>
                    <p>X‚Äërays? Clear. Echocardiography? Normal. The cardiologist looked puzzled. ‚ÄúOnly 30. No alcohol, no smoking, no drugs‚Ä¶ and still this?‚Äù</p>
                    <p>But I knew the diagnosis wasn‚Äôt in my reports. It was in the messages, the calls, the ache of longing stretched across 7,000 miles. It was you. Meezna.</p>
                    <p>Every morning, the first thing I do is check my phone. Not for the world‚Äîonly for your message.</p>
                    <p>We talk all day, switching between texting and calling like we‚Äôre trying to close the distance inch by inch, voice by voice.</p>
                    <p>At night, you‚Äôre the last person I speak to. My day begins and ends with you.</p>
                    <p>And that‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äîlove isn‚Äôt always soft. Sometimes, it comes as a storm in your chest.</p>
                    <p>I wasn‚Äôt sick. I was simply overwhelmed by the weight of missing you too much, too deeply.</p>
                    <p>My heart was beating at 145 per minute, constantly‚Äîfor over 24 hours. No fever. No symptoms. No pain. Just a storm within.</p>
                    <p>She looked at the monitor, then at me, and asked, ‚ÄúDo you even realize how dangerous this is?‚Äù</p>
                    <p>And there I was, lying in the hospital bed, smiling softly. Because how could I explain?</p>
                    <p>It‚Äôs not the body that‚Äôs struggling. It‚Äôs the heart‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs filled with someone who‚Äôs not here.</p>

            Today, she asked about a video I sent her ‚Äî not the visuals, but the music playing softly behind it.

            I hadn‚Äôt even realized which song it was until she mentioned it. When I replayed it‚Ä¶ it hit me:
            <strong>"Main rahoon ya na rahoon, tum mujh mein kahin baaki rehna."</strong>  
            One of my favorites. And maybe, ours.

            She said, <em>‚ÄúHamro ni relation yestai complicated xa ni hai...‚Äù</em>  
            I asked, ‚ÄúYeti complicated cha ra?‚Äù  
            She replied with a knowing smile, <em>‚ÄúYo geet hera na‚Ä¶‚Äù</em>
            And suddenly, everything made sense.

            <span style="background-color:#fff3cd; padding:4px 8px; border-radius:4px;">We are in love, and yet we walk parallel ‚Äî never crossing, never breaking.</span>  
            I am married.  
            She has a boyfriend.  
            But between the spaces of duty and loyalty, we‚Äôve written something unspoken.

            <blockquote>
                ‚ÄúEk din... maybe just a few hours, or one night, or one stolen sunrise‚Äî
                We will live this love.
                <i><b>>Fully.
                Without guilt.
                Without hiding.
                Without fear.‚Äù</b></i>
            </blockquote>

            We don't want forever.  
            <span style="color:#8a4f4f;"><strong>We just want one moment to be fully ours.</strong></span>

            It‚Äôs not lust.  
            It‚Äôs not cheating.  
            It‚Äôs <em>presence</em>.  
            It‚Äôs about honoring what we feel ‚Äî with dignity, silence, and sincerity.

            <span style="background-color:#ffeef2; padding:4px 6px; border-radius:6px;">She may belong to someone else. I do too. But part of us will always belong here ‚Äî in the space only we understand.</span>

            One day, if we ever meet beyond this world‚Äôs boundaries ‚Äî  
            even for a single sunrise ‚Äî  
            we‚Äôll fulfill the promise we made quietly:  
            <strong>To live our boundless love, just once, completely.</strong>

                    <p>Today began like many others‚Äîwith a sleepy hello from her side. She had just woken up, feeling weak, dizzy, and unsteady. Seeing her struggle through the video call, I felt an ache in my chest.</p>
                    <p>I reminded her to eat properly, to rest, and to take care of herself. It‚Äôs in these small, fleeting moments that I realize how much I care.</p>
                    <p>Even while she was busy at work, managing so many patients, she kept me updated, showing her warmth in little ways.</p>
                    <p>Later, when I saw her live, she looked beautiful as always, but her usual glow was missing‚Äîmaybe a reflection of her tired heart.</p>
                    <p>When she called, there was a moment of frustration in her tone, but that soon melted into soft laughter. She admitted that she had missed me during the day, even when she was with others.</p>
                    <p>It‚Äôs moments like these‚Äîwhen she lets her guard down and shows her vulnerability‚Äîthat remind me of how special this bond is.</p>
                    <p>Her health worries me, yet I see her fighting through, holding on, being strong.</p>
                    <p>And I‚Äôll keep reminding her to eat, to rest, to take care of herself‚Äînot just for me, but for her own happiness and the people she loves.</p>
                    <p>Tonight, before bed, she told me to wake her up in the morning. That simple request, that trust, it speaks volumes.</p>

                content: `
                    <p>Today, the message I received from her stirred a deep, tender feeling within me. Her words made me realize the depth of her heart, the vulnerability of her life‚Äôs experiences.</p>
                    <p>The heart emoji, though small, carried a weight of meaning‚Äîa light in the darkness of her emotions.</p>
                    <p>Her message gave me a glimpse into her emotional world, and though she wrote, ‚ÄúI am crying,‚Äù those tears, though not directly from the heart, still reflect the profound effect my presence and support have on her.</p>
                    <p>It‚Äôs a reminder that simply being there for someone‚Äîoffering understanding and a constant presence‚Äîcan have a powerful impact, even if words alone can't fully express it.</p>
                    <p>Today‚Äôs journal captures these moments, reminding me how love and emotional connection can transcend distance and time.</p>
                    <p>Her heart, a reflection of her gratitude, leaves a lasting impact on me, making me more aware of how precious and significant the bond we share is.</p>

                    <p>Not with promises of forever under the same roof,</p>
                    <p>But with promises of never hurting the roofs we already built.</p>
                    <p>We were two souls‚Äîbruised but breathing, who found healing in each other‚Äôs words, laughter in midnight silence, and strength in shared stories.</p>
                    <p>You taught me how to love my world again. I gave you the space to feel seen without fear.</p>
