        content: `
          <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2:00 PM<br><strong>Location:</strong> Library</p>
          <p>We talked today—on a live call. Different places, yet somehow our minds felt aligned.</p>
          <p>I was in the library, pretending to read. She was at the hospital, on duty. Tired, but her voice still had that same warmth.</p>
          <p>Then she asked me: “How much do you miss me?” My heart skipped. There was something in the way she asked… a kind of quiet longing.</p>
          <p>I smiled and replied lightly— “I feel like I see you between the lines of these pages. Even the letters can’t hide you.”</p>
          <p>But that wasn’t the truth. The truth is—I wasn’t even looking at the pages. I was trying to see <em>her</em> in them. Trying to <strong>feel</strong> her in the silence between words.</p>
          <p>Then she said, softly— “You love me this much even from a distance? I wonder how much you'd love me if we were truly together…”</p>
          <p>I went quiet. Because what I really wanted to say was—</p>
          <p>“I know I can’t call you mine. I know one day, you’ll belong to someone else. But this love… this love isn’t about seeing you. It’s about choosing to keep looking for you, even when I know I might never reach you.”</p>
          <p>But I didn’t say it. Because sometimes… the words that matter most are the ones we keep within.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Reflections:</strong><br>June 7, 2025</p>
          <p>I’m not trying to forget her. I’m not trying to possess her. I’m simply trying to be a quiet presence in her journey— like the calm after a storm, like a familiar voice in a dark room.</p>
          <p>And maybe, that’s what <strong>boundless love</strong> really is:<br>
          A love that doesn’t ask for anything,<br>
          But gives everything in silence,<br>
          Just to make someone feel a little less alone.</p>

  content: `
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Elmhurst Hospital Centre, New York</p>
    <p>I was admitted to the hospital due to tachycardia—pulse running wild, heart refusing to calm down. Three days in a hospital bed, under constant monitoring.</p>
    <p>X-rays? Clear. Echocardiography? Normal. The cardiologist looked puzzled. “Only 30. No alcohol, no smoking, no drugs… and still this?”</p>
    <p>But I knew the diagnosis wasn’t in my reports. It was in the messages, the calls, the ache of longing stretched across 7,000 miles. It was you. Meezna.</p>
    <p>Every morning, the first thing I do is check my phone. Not for the world—only for your message.</p>
    <p>We talk all day, switching between texting and calling like we’re trying to close the distance inch by inch, voice by voice.</p>
    <p>At night, you’re the last person I speak to. My day begins and ends with you.</p>
    <p>And that’s when it hit me—love isn’t always soft. Sometimes, it comes as a storm in your chest.</p>
    <p>I wasn’t sick. I was simply overwhelmed by the weight of missing you too much, too deeply.</p>
    <p>My heart was beating at 145 per minute, constantly—for over 24 hours. No fever. No symptoms. No pain. Just a storm within.</p>
    <p>She looked at the monitor, then at me, and asked, “Do you even realize how dangerous this is?”</p>
    <p>And there I was, lying in the hospital bed, smiling softly. Because how could I explain?</p>
    <p>It’s not the body that’s struggling. It’s the heart—because it’s filled with someone who’s not here.</p>

  title: "Today’s Journal Entry – Boundless Love 🌸",
  content: `
    <p><strong>Time:</strong> 4:54 PM<br><strong>Location:</strong> New York</p>
    <p>Today began like many others—with a sleepy hello from her side. She had just woken up, feeling weak, dizzy, and unsteady. Seeing her struggle through the video call, I felt an ache in my chest.</p>
    <p>I reminded her to eat properly, to rest, and to take care of herself. It’s in these small, fleeting moments that I realize how much I care.</p>
    <p>Even while she was busy at work, managing so many patients, she kept me updated, showing her warmth in little ways.</p>
    <p>Later, when I saw her live, she looked beautiful as always, but her usual glow was missing—maybe a reflection of her tired heart.</p>
    <p>When she called, there was a moment of frustration in her tone, but that soon melted into soft laughter. She admitted that she had missed me during the day, even when she was with others.</p>
    <p>It’s moments like these—when she lets her guard down and shows her vulnerability—that remind me of how special this bond is.</p>
    <p>Her health worries me, yet I see her fighting through, holding on, being strong.</p>
    <p>And I’ll keep reminding her to eat, to rest, to take care of herself—not just for me, but for her own happiness and the people she loves.</p>
    <p>Tonight, before bed, she told me to wake her up in the morning. That simple request, that trust, it speaks volumes.</p>
    <p>And so, I’ll stay here, always ready to be her quiet strength.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> May 26, 2025</p>
    <p>Meezna, you’re not just a friend. You’re a part of my story, my family in spirit. Your happiness is my happiness, and your smile is my peace.</p>
    <p>Thank you for letting me be here for you, in the little ways that matter.</p>
