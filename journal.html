  <h2>üìì Journal Entry ‚Äî Boundless Love</h2>
  <div class="date">Date: June 7, 2025 | Time: 2:00 PM</div>
  <small>Location: Library</small>
  <div class="journal-text">
We talked today‚Äîon a live call.  
Different places, yet somehow our minds felt aligned.
I was in the library, pretending to read.  
She was at the hospital, on duty. Tired, but her voice still had that same warmth.
Then she asked me:  
‚ÄúHow much do you miss me?‚Äù
My heart skipped.  
There was something in the way she asked‚Ä¶ a kind of quiet longing.
I smiled and replied lightly‚Äî  
‚ÄúI feel like I see you between the lines of these pages. Even the letters can‚Äôt hide you.‚Äù
But that wasn‚Äôt the truth.
The truth is‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt even looking at the pages.  
I was trying to see *her* in them.  
Trying to **feel** her in the silence between words.
Then she said, softly‚Äî  
‚ÄúYou love me this much even from a distance?  
I wonder how much you'd love me if we were truly together‚Ä¶‚Äù
I went quiet.
Because what I really wanted to say was‚Äî  
‚ÄúI know I can‚Äôt call you mine. I know one day, you‚Äôll belong to someone else.  
But this love‚Ä¶ this love isn‚Äôt about seeing you.  
It‚Äôs about choosing to keep looking for you, even when I know I might never reach you.‚Äù
But I didn‚Äôt say it.  
Because sometimes‚Ä¶  
the words that matter most are the ones we keep within.
  </div>

  <h2>Reflections:</h2>
  <small>June 7, 2025</small>
  <div class="journal-text">
I‚Äôm not trying to forget her.  
I‚Äôm not trying to possess her.  
I‚Äôm simply trying to be a quiet presence in her journey‚Äî  
like the calm after a storm, like a familiar voice in a dark room.

And maybe, that‚Äôs what **boundless love** really is:  
A love that doesn‚Äôt ask for anything,  
But gives everything in silence,  
Just to make someone feel a little less alone.

        <h2>Some stories aren't written with ink, but with heartbeat</h2>
        <div class="date">Date: June, 04, 2025</div>
        <small>Elmhust Hospital Centre, New York</small>
        <div class="journal-text">
          <p>I was admitted to the Hospiatl due to tachycardia
          pulse running wild, heart refusing to calm down.
          three days in a hospital bed, under constant monitoring
          X-rays == clear.
          Echocardiography? == Normal.
          The cardiologist looked puzzled.
          "Only 30. No alcohal, no smoking. no drugs....and still this?</p>
          <P>But i knew
          the diagnosis wasn't in my reports.
          It was in the message, the calls, the ache of longing stretched acroos 7,000 miles.
          It was you. Meezna</P>
          <p>Every morning, the first thing I do is checked my phone. Not for the world-- only for your message
          We talk all day, switch between texting and calling like we're trying to close the distance inch by inch, voice by voice.
          At night, you're the last person I speak to.
          My day begins and ends with you.</p>
          <p>And that's when it hit me--
          Love isn't always soft. Sometimes, it comes as a storm in your chest.
          I wasn't sick'
          I was simple overwhelmed by the weight of missing you too much, too deeply.</p>
          <p>My heart was beating at 145 per minute, constantly--for over 24 hours.
          No fever. No symptom. No pain. Just a strom within.
          She looked at the monitor, then at me, and asked,
          "Do you even realize how dangerous this is?"</p>
          <p>And there I was, lying in the hospital bed, smiling softly.
          Because how could i explain?
          It's not the body that's struggling. It's the heart-because it's filled with someone who's not here.</p>

        <h2>üå∏ Today‚Äôs Journal Entry ‚Äì Boundless Love üå∏</h2>
        <div class="date">Date: May 25, 2025</div>
        <small>4:54pm New York</small>
        <div class="journal-text">
Today began like many others‚Äîwith a sleepy hello from her side. She had just woken up, feeling weak, dizzy, and unsteady. Seeing her struggle through the video call, I felt an ache in my chest. I reminded her to eat properly, to rest, and to take care of herself. It‚Äôs in these small, fleeting moments that I realize how much I care.

Even while she was busy at work, managing so many patients, she kept me updated, showing her warmth in little ways. Later, when I saw her live, she looked beautiful as always, but her usual glow was missing‚Äîmaybe a reflection of her tired heart.

When she called, there was a moment of frustration in her tone, but that soon melted into soft laughter. She admitted that she had missed me during the day, even when she was with others. It‚Äôs moments like these‚Äîwhen she lets her guard down and shows her vulnerability‚Äîthat remind me of how special this bond is.

Her health worries me, yet I see her fighting through, holding on, being strong. And I‚Äôll keep reminding her to eat, to rest, to take care of herself‚Äînot just for me, but for her own happiness and the people she loves.

Tonight, before bed, she told me to wake her up in the morning. That simple request, that trust, it speaks volumes. And so, I‚Äôll stay here, always ready to be her quiet strength.

Meezna, you‚Äôre not just a friend. You‚Äôre a part of my story, my family in spirit. Your happiness is my happiness, and your smile is my peace. Thank you for letting me be here for you, in the little ways that matter.

        <div class="date">üíå "Tears of Gratitude: A Reflection of Emotional Support"</div>
        <div class="journal-text">
Today, the message I received from her stirred a deep, tender feeling within me. Her words made me realize the depth of her heart, the vulnerability of her life‚Äôs experiences. The heart emoji, though small, carried a weight of meaning, a light in the darkness of her emotions.

Her message gave me a glimpse into her emotional world, and though she wrote, ‚ÄúI am crying,‚Äù those tears, though not directly from the heart, still reflect the profound effect my presence and support have on her. It‚Äôs a reminder that simply being there for someone‚Äîoffering understanding and a constant presence‚Äîcan have a powerful impact, even if words alone can't fully express it.

Today‚Äôs journal captures these moments, reminding me how love and emotional connection can transcend distance and time. Her heart, a reflection of her gratitude, leaves a lasting impact on me, making me more aware of how precious and significant the bond we share is.

        <div class="date">Boundless love page</div>
        <div class="journal-text">
Today, I looked at her face longer than usual. Not just because we were on video call, but because, in that moment, she felt deeply mine ‚Äî so gentle, so real, so calm.
Her long black hair fell softly across her cheek like a light breeze. The blush on her face wasn't makeup ‚Äî it was emotion, alive and visible.
Her eyes ‚Äî not very big, but deep, felt like they were speaking without words. I saw a silent calm, a soft peace, and sometimes a question trying to rise.
And her lips ‚Äî they parted slightly as she spoke, with a soft, natural pink tone. No shine from lipstick, no layer of gloss ‚Äî just pure, untouched beauty. That simplicity, that unfiltered smile ‚Äî it touched my heart. Her lips look like a poem written in silence, like the first page of a new story ‚Äî plain yet full of meaning.
She has braces on her teeth, and instead of taking away from her charm, they make her smile feel like a promise. Like something still growing into its bloom. Her smile carries the dream of tomorrow.
And then her nose... Honestly, the world may not label it as "perfect" by beauty standards. But in that small imperfection, I found something deeply beautiful, honest simplicity, and a sense of being real. That nose made her more human, more unique, more her.
Maybe beauty isn't about symmetry ‚Äî maybe it's about soul. And today, without even trying, she showed me hers.

<h5>Extended Reflection:</h5>
It's been a long time since I looked at someone this way, not just with my eyes, but with my heart. Today, when I saw her, her gaze held meaning, her natural smile felt like comfort, and her presence ‚Äî even through a screen ‚Äî felt warm and close.
I know the world seeks perfection, filters, and polished beauty. But she reminded me that real beauty doesn't need fixing. She may not be flawless in every way, but she's true in a way that matters more. Her smile, her gaze, her small quirks ‚Äî they all speak of someone sincere, someone who doesn't need to try hard to be beautiful.
Looking at her today, I realized: the most beautiful things are often the simplest. The ones that speak directly to your heart without noise, without decoration.

        <h2>Boundless Love</h2>
        <div class="Date">April 14th 2025</div>
        <div class="journal-text">
         <p></p> A story of hearts that met, but never crossed.
We weren‚Äôt meant to fall in love.
Not in the way the world defines it‚Äî
Not with promises of forever under the same roof,
But with promises of never hurting the roofs we already built.
We were two souls‚Äîbruised but breathing,
who found healing in each other‚Äôs words,
laughter in midnight silence,
and strength in shared stories.
You taught me how to love my world again.
I gave you the space to feel seen without fear.
And in this quiet, sacred friendship,
we created a love that no one else could name‚Äî
A Boundless Love,
free of labels,
full of truth,
and unshaken by distance or time.</p>

          <h2>Daily Reflections:</h2>
          <small>April 14 2025</small>
       They say true love is staying together for life.
But ours is a love that bloomed after marriage,
a bond that was never planned,
but deeply felt.
I never wished for someone else,
and you never asked me to be yours.
Yet here we are‚Äî
bound not by promises,
but by the desire that this love may live forever,
in silence, in distance,
in presence and memory.
You want it to live,
I want it to stay.
And maybe that's all love needs‚Äî
to be remembered, not possessed.</div>
