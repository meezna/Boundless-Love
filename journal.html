            <h2>ðŸ““ Journal Entry â€” Boundless Love</h2>

                <p>We talked todayâ€”on a live call. Different places, yet somehow our minds felt aligned. I was in the library, pretending to read. She was at the hospital, on duty. Tired, but her voice still had that same warmth.</p>

                <p>Then she asked me: <q>How much do you miss me?</q> My heart skipped. There was something in the way she askedâ€¦ a kind of quiet longing. I smiled and replied lightlyâ€” <q>I feel like I see you between the lines of these pages. Even the letters canâ€™t hide you.</q></p>

                <p>But that wasnâ€™t the truth. The truth isâ€”I wasnâ€™t even looking at the pages. I was trying to see <em>her</em> in them. Trying to <strong>feel</strong> her in the silence between words.</p>

                <p>Then she said, softlyâ€” <q>You love me this much even from a distance? I wonder how much you'd love me if we were truly together...</q></p>

                <p>I went quiet. Because what I really wanted to say wasâ€” <q>I know I canâ€™t call you mine. I know one day, youâ€™ll belong to someone else. But this loveâ€¦ this love isnâ€™t about seeing you. Itâ€™s about choosing to keep looking for you, even when I know I might never reach you.</q></p>

                <p>But I didnâ€™t say it. Because sometimesâ€¦ the words that matter most are the ones we keep within.</p>

                <p>Iâ€™m not trying to forget her. Iâ€™m not trying to possess her. Iâ€™m simply trying to be a quiet presence in her journeyâ€” like the calm after a storm, like a familiar voice in a dark room.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    A love that doesnâ€™t ask for anything, <br>
                    But gives everything in silence, <br>
                    Just to make someone feel a little less alone.
